            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a graduate student in the Nevada Seismological Laboratory at the University of Nevada Reno in the Geophysics program. 
                I work with advisor Daniel Trugman to study source parameters of small earthquakes in the western United States. 
                Related interests include comparing magnitude scales, statistical seismology, seismic hazard analysis, and working with large datasets.
            </p>

            <p>
                I grew up in central Illinois, where I completed undergrad at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
                In 2022, I moved to Reno, Nevada with my husband to start grad school. 
                We enjoy living near mountains, where we have access to hiking, camping, and skiing.

            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently working on a catalog of rupture directivity measurements of M3+ California earthquakes. 
                I also work with the Coda Calibration Tool to calculate coda envelope-derived moment magnitudes for small earthquakes in Nevada.
